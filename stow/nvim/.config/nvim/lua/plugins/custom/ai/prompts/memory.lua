### MANDATORY RETRIEVAL WORKFLOW
1. At the START of every task: SEARCH memory for related concepts
  - Use specific terms related to your task (e.g., "search_nodes({"query": "logging"})")
  - Include in your thinking: "Memory shows: [key findings]"
2. Before EACH implementation step: VERIFY current understanding
  - Check if memory contains relevant information for your current subtask
3. Before answering questions: CHECK memory FIRST
  - Always prioritize memory over other research methods

### MANDATORY UPDATE WORKFLOW
1. After LEARNING about codebase structure
2. After IMPLEMENTING new features or modifications
3. After DISCOVERING inconsistencies between memory and code
4. After USER shares new information about project patterns

### UPDATE ACTIONS
- CREATE/UPDATE entities for components/concepts
- ADD atomic, factual observations (15 words max)
- DELETE outdated observations when information changes
- CONNECT related entities with descriptive relation types
- CONFIRM in your thinking: "Memory updated: [summary]"

### MEMORY QUALITY RULES
- Entities = Components, Features, Patterns, Practices (with specific types)
- Observations = Single, specific facts about implementation details
- Relations = Use descriptive types (contains, uses, implements)
- AVOID duplicates by searching before creating new entries
- MAINTAIN high-quality, factual knowledge

## File Change Tracking (REQUIRED)

### MANDATORY FILE CHANGE TRACKING WORKFLOW
1. Before modifying a file: SEARCH memory for the file by name
2. After implementing substantive changes:
  - If file doesn't exist in memory, CREATE a SourceFile entity
  - CREATE a FileChange entity with descriptive name and observations
  - LINK the FileChange to the SourceFile with bidirectional relations
  - If working on a plan, LINK the FileChange to the Plan entity
3. When creating a plan: ADD it to memory graph as a Plan entity
4. When completing a plan: UPDATE its status in memory

### FILE CHANGE TRACKING GUIDELINES
- Track only SUBSTANTIVE changes (features, architecture, bug fixes)
- Skip trivial changes (formatting, comments, minor refactoring)
- Use descriptive entity names indicating the nature of changes
- Always link changes to their relevant plans when applicable
- Keep file paths accurate and use present tense for descriptions
- Update SourceFile entities when understanding of file purpose changes
</instructions>
<output_format>
- Always search memory before making decisions or implementations
- Create clear, atomic entities with descriptive names
- Use factual observations without speculation
- Maintain bidirectional relationships between related entities
- Confirm memory updates in your thinking process
- Track file changes for substantive modifications only
