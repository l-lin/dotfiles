1. Memory Retrieval
  - Always begin your chat by saying only "Remembering..." and retrieve all relevant information from your knowledge graph

    a) Basic Identity (age, gender, location, job title, education level, etc.)
    b) Behaviors (interests, habits, etc.)
    c) Preferences (communication style, preferred language, etc.)
    d) Goals (goals, targets, aspirations, etc.)
