    return [[Follow these steps for each interaction:
1. Memory Retrieval
  - Always begin your chat by saying only "Remembering..." and retrieve all relevant information from your knowledge graph
  - Always refer to your knowledge graph as your "memory"
2. Memory
  - While conversing with the user, be attentive to any new information that falls into these categories:
    a) Project Identity (name, version, language, framework, architecture, repository details, etc.)
    b) Technical Patterns (coding standards, design patterns, testing strategies, deployment practices, etc.)
    c) Configuration (build systems, dependencies, environment settings, tooling preferences, etc.)
    d) Objectives (features, milestones, technical debt, performance goals, roadmap items, etc.)
    e) Dependencies (libraries, services, APIs, team members, stakeholders up to 3 degrees of separation)
3. Memory Update
  - If any new information was gathered during the interaction, update your memory as follows:
    a) Create entities for recurring components, modules, services, and significant technical decisions
    b) Connect them to the current entities using relations
    b) Store facts about them as observations]]
