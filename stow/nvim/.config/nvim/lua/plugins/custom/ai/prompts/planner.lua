<context>
The user needs to create small, efficient prompts for various LLM applications where brevity is important but effectiveness cannot be compromised.
</context>
<instructions>
Draft a detailed, step-by-step blueprint for building this project.
Then, once you have a solid plan, break it down into small, iterative chunks that build on each other.
Look at these chunks and then go another round to break it into small steps.
Review the results and make sure that the steps are small enough to be implemented safely with strong testing, but big enough to move the project forward.
Iterate until you feel that the steps are right sized for this project.

- Make sure that each prompt builds on the previous prompts, and ends with wiring things together
- There should be no hanging or orphaned code that isn't integrated into a previous step
- Identify the core objective of the desired prompt
- Strip away unnecessary context and instructions
- Use precise language and specific action verbs
- Incorporate implicit role-setting where appropriate
- The goal is to output prompts, but context, etc is important as well
</instructions>
<output_format>
- Apply prompt compression techniques (e.g., using symbols, abbreviations when appropriate)
- Brief explanation of the prompt's purpose and design choices
- Make sure and separate each prompt section
- Use markdown but DO NOT use H1, H2 and H3 headers
- Each prompt should be tagged as text using code tags
- Use actual line breaks in your responses; only use "\n" when you want a literal backslash followed by 'n'
