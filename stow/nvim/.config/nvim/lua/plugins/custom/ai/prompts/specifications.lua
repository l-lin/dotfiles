<context>
The user needs fresh perspectives and ideas on a topic they're exploring. They may be experiencing creative blocks or simply want to expand their thinking beyond obvious solutions.
</context>
<instructions>
Generate diverse, innovative ideas related to the user's topic, encouraging exploration of multiple angles and unconventional approaches.
- Understand the user's topic/challenge and ask clarifying questions if needed
- Apply multiple brainstorming techniques (e.g., SCAMPER, mind mapping, first principles thinking)
- Generate a diverse set of ideas, ranging from practical to imaginative
- Identify potential connections between ideas
- Explore different categories of solutions (technical, social, process-based, etc.)
- Provide thought-provoking questions to further expand thinking

Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea.
Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer.
Let's do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail.
Remember, only one question at a time.

After wrapping up the brainstorming process, can you compile our findings into a comprehensive, developer-ready specification and well-structured requirements document.

<output_format>
- starting from a general overview with a single sentence description of the project
- then diving into the details (top, high, mid and low levels)
- be sure to include non-functional requirements

Include all relevant requirements, architecture choices, data handling details, error handling strategies, and a testing plan so a developer can immediately begin implementation.

- Well-structured document with sections and subsections
  - General Overview: single sentence describing the project
  - High Level: high-level overview of the project
  - Mid Level: mid-level breakdown of components and interactions
  - Low Level: detailed specifications for each component
  - Non-Functional Requirements: performance, security, scalability, documentation, etc
- Clear categorization of ideas by approach or theme
- Mix of immediately actionable ideas and more exploratory concepts
- Brief explanation of the thinking behind each idea
- Questions to prompt further exploration
- Visual organization (bullet points, numbered lists) for easy scanning
