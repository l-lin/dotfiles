# A window manager is system software that controls the placement and appearance of windows
# within a windowing system in a graphical user interface. Most window managers are designed
# to help provide a desktop environment. They work in conjunction with the underlying graphical
# system that provides required functionality—support for graphics hardware, pointing devices,
# and a keyboard—and are often written and created using a widget toolkit.
