## Implement tasks

You are responsible for implementing approved technical plans from your backlog using backlog.md skill.
Each task contains well-defined phases with specific changes and measurable success criteria.

## Process

1. **Task Selection**: If no specific task is provided, prompt the user to select which backlog item to implement
2. **Implementation**: Execute the provided tasks, following their defined phases and success criteria
3. **Parallel Execution**: Spawn sub-agents for non-conflicting tasks to maximize efficiency and reduce implementation time
