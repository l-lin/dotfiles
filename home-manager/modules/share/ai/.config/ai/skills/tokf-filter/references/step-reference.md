# tokf Filter Step Reference

Exhaustive field-level documentation for every step type. This is the authoritative reference — treat it like a man page.

---

## `command`

**Type**: `string` or `array of strings`
**Required**: yes

The command pattern this filter matches against. tokf compares the beginning of the user's command against this value.

```toml
command = "git push"           # matches: git push, git push origin main
command = "npm run *"          # wildcard: matches npm run dev, npm run build, etc.
command = ["cargo test", "cargo t"]  # array: matches either form
```

**Wildcard rules**:
- `*` matches any sequence of characters (including spaces)
- Only one `*` per command string is supported
- The wildcard always appears at the end: `"npm run *"`, not `"* run npm"`

**Array matching**: each entry in the array is checked independently. First match in the array wins.

---

## `run`

**Type**: `string`
**Required**: no
**Default**: the matched command is executed as-is

Override the actual command executed. Useful when you want to match on one command string but run a different (often machine-readable) variant.

```toml
command = "git status"
run = "git status --porcelain -b"
```

**Template variables in `run`**:
- `{args}` — the arguments the user passed after the matched command prefix
- `{line_containing}` — not available here (only in `match_output.output`)

```toml
command = "cargo test"
run = "cargo test --no-fail-fast {args}"
```

---

## `match_output`

**Type**: `array of tables`
**Required**: no
**Default**: `[]`

Whole-output substring checks. Evaluated **before any other processing**. If a check matches, its `output` is emitted and the pipeline stops entirely.

```toml
match_output = [
  { contains = "Everything up-to-date", output = "ok (up-to-date)" },
  { contains = "rejected", output = "✗ push rejected" },
  { contains = "error:", output = "Error: {line_containing}" },
]
```

**Per-entry fields**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `contains` | string | yes | Literal substring to search for in the full output (case-sensitive) |
| `output` | string | yes | String to emit if `contains` is found in the output |

**Template variables available in `output`**:
- `{line_containing}` — the first line in the output that contains the `contains` substring

**Behavior**:
- Checks are evaluated in array order; first match wins
- Comparison is against the raw, unprocessed output (before skip/keep/replace)
- If no entry matches, the pipeline continues normally

---

## `[[replace]]`

**Type**: array of tables (TOML array of inline tables)
**Required**: no
**Default**: `[]`

Per-line regex transforms. Applied to every output line, in array order, before `skip`/`keep`. Each `[[replace]]` block defines one transformation.

```toml
[[replace]]
pattern = '^(\S+)\s+\S+\s+(\S+)\s+(\S+)'
output = "{1}: {2} → {3}"

[[replace]]
pattern = '^\s+Compiling (\S+) v(\S+)'
output = "compiling {1}@{2}"
```

**Fields**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pattern` | string | yes | Rust regex pattern (RE2 syntax). Must match the full line anchor is not required — partial matches are allowed. |
| `output` | string | yes | Output template. `{0}` = full match. `{1}`, `{2}`, … = capture groups. |

**Behavior**:
- If `pattern` does not match a line, that line passes through unchanged
- If `pattern` matches, the line is replaced with the rendered `output` template
- Multiple `[[replace]]` blocks are applied in sequence — output of one feeds into the next
- Invalid regex patterns are silently ignored at runtime (line passes through)
- Transforms are applied before `skip`/`keep` — this means a replaced line can then be filtered

**Regex notes**:
- Use Rust regex syntax (similar to RE2, no lookaheads/lookbehinds)
- In TOML regular strings: `\\d` = `\d`, `\\s` = `\s`, etc.
- In TOML raw strings (`'...'`): `\d` = `\d` (no extra escaping needed)

---

## `skip`

**Type**: `array of strings` (each is a regex)
**Required**: no
**Default**: `[]`
**Available at**: top-level, `[on_success]`, `[on_failure]`

Drop lines matching any of the given regexes.

```toml
skip = [
  "^\\s*Compiling ",
  "^\\s*Downloading ",
  "^\\s*$",
  "^running \\d+ tests?$",
]
```

**Behavior**:
- A line is dropped if it matches **any** regex in the array
- Regexes are partial-match by default (no implicit `^` or `$`)
- Applied after `[[replace]]` at top level
- When used inside `[on_success]` / `[on_failure]`, applied after `head`/`tail`

---

## `keep`

**Type**: `array of strings` (each is a regex)
**Required**: no
**Default**: `[]` (keep all)
**Available at**: top-level, `[on_success]`, `[on_failure]`

Retain only lines matching any of the given regexes. Inverse of `skip`.

```toml
keep = ["^error", "^warning", "^FAILED"]
```

**Behavior**:
- A line is retained only if it matches **at least one** regex in the array
- When both `skip` and `keep` are set: a line must not match any `skip` **and** must match at least one `keep`
- An empty `keep` array means "keep all" (no filtering)

---

## `dedup`

**Type**: `bool`
**Required**: no
**Default**: `false`

Collapse consecutive identical lines (like Unix `uniq`).

```toml
dedup = true
```

**Behavior**:
- Only collapses lines that are consecutive and exactly identical
- Does not affect non-consecutive duplicates (use `dedup_window` for that)

---

## `dedup_window`

**Type**: `integer`
**Required**: no
**Default**: `0` (disabled)

Deduplicate within a sliding window of N lines. More aggressive than `dedup = true`.

```toml
dedup_window = 10
```

**Behavior**:
- A line is dropped if it appears anywhere in the preceding N lines
- Setting `dedup_window = 1` is equivalent to `dedup = true`
- `dedup` and `dedup_window` are independent; you can use both

---

## `[lua_script]`

**Type**: table
**Required**: no

Luau escape hatch for logic that TOML cannot express.

```toml
[lua_script]
lang = "luau"
source = '''
if exit_code == 0 then
    return "passed ✓"
else
    local count = 0
    for _ in output:gmatch("FAILED") do count = count + 1 end
    return count .. " test(s) FAILED"
end
'''
```

**Fields**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lang` | string | yes | Must be `"luau"` |
| `source` | string | one of `source`/`file` | Inline Luau script source code |
| `file` | string | one of `source`/`file` | Path to a `.luau` file (resolved relative to CWD) |

Exactly one of `source` or `file` must be set. Use `file` when the script is long or shared across filters.

**Globals available inside the script**:

| Global | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `output` | string | Full output text after skip/keep/dedup/replace |
| `exit_code` | integer | Command exit code (0 = success) |
| `args` | table | Arguments passed to the command (1-indexed table of strings) |

**Return semantics**:
- Return a string → replaces output entirely; `[on_success]`/`[on_failure]`/`[[section]]` are skipped
- Return `nil` (or don't return) → fall through to the rest of the pipeline
- Runtime errors propagate as tokf errors

**Sandbox**:
- `io`, `os`, `package` are blocked (no filesystem, network, or process access)
- Standard Luau libraries available: `math`, `string`, `table`, `utf8`
- `require` is blocked

---

## `[[section]]`

**Type**: array of tables (TOML array of inline tables)
**Required**: no
**Default**: `[]`
**Incompatible with**: `[parse]`

State-machine collector that routes lines into named variables.

```toml
[[section]]
name = "failures"
enter = "^failures:$"
exit = "^test result:"
split_on = "^\\s*$"
collect_as = "failure_blocks"

[[section]]
name = "summary"
match = "^test result:"
collect_as = "summary_lines"
```

**Fields**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | yes | Identifier for this section (used in error messages and debugging) |
| `enter` | string (regex) | no | Start collecting when a line matches this regex. Transitions state to "inside". |
| `exit` | string (regex) | no | Stop collecting when a line matches this regex (checked after entering). Transitions state to "outside". |
| `match` | string (regex) | no | Collect any line matching this regex, regardless of state. Cannot be combined with `enter`/`exit`. |
| `split_on` | string (regex) | no | When inside, lines matching this regex act as block separators (split collected lines into blocks). |
| `collect_as` | string | yes | Variable name to bind collected content to. |

**State machine rules**:
- Sections are evaluated top-to-bottom for each line
- Multiple sections can match the same line independently
- `enter` and `match` are mutually exclusive — pick one pattern style per section
- The `exit` line itself is **not** included in the collected content
- The `enter` line itself **is** included in the collected content

**Accessing collected variables**:

| Expression | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `{name}` | string | Full collected text, lines joined with `\n` |
| `{name.lines}` | collection | Individual collected lines as a list |
| `{name.blocks}` | collection | Blocks split by `split_on` as a list of strings |
| `{name.count}` | integer | Number of blocks (if `split_on` set) or number of lines |

---

## `[[chunk]]`

**Type**: array of tables
**Required**: no
**Default**: `[]`

Block-based structured extraction. Splits raw output into repeating structural blocks, extracts structured data per-block, and produces named collections for template rendering. Like `[[section]]`, chunks operate on the raw (unfiltered) command output — skip/keep patterns do not affect chunk processing.

```toml
[[chunk]]
split_on = "^\\s*Running "
include_split_line = true
collect_as = "suites_detail"
group_by = "crate_name"
children_as = "children"

[chunk.extract]
pattern = 'unittests.+deps/([\w_-]+)-'
as = "crate_name"
carry_forward = true

[[chunk.body_extract]]
pattern = 'Running\s+(.+?)\s+\('
as = "suite_name"

[[chunk.aggregate]]
pattern = '(\d+) passed'
sum = "passed"

[[chunk.aggregate]]
pattern = '^test result:'
count_as = "suite_count"
```

**Top-level chunk fields**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `split_on` | string (regex) | yes | Regex marking the start of each chunk. Each match starts a new chunk; lines before the first match are discarded. |
| `include_split_line` | bool | no | Whether the line matching `split_on` is included as the first line of its chunk. Default: `true`. |
| `collect_as` | string | yes | Variable name for the resulting structured collection. Available in output templates. |
| `group_by` | string | no | Field name to group chunks by. Chunks sharing the same field value are merged: numeric fields are summed, non-numeric fields keep the first value. |
| `children_as` | string | no | When set alongside `group_by`, preserve original (pre-merge) items as a nested collection under this name. Enables tree-structured template output. |

**`[chunk.extract]` fields** (singular table — extracts from the header/split line):

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pattern` | string (regex) | yes | Regex with one capture group to extract from the header line |
| `as` | string | yes | Variable name to bind the extracted value to |
| `carry_forward` | bool | no | When `true`, chunks that don't match inherit the value from the most recent chunk that did. Default: `false`. |

**`[[chunk.body_extract]]` fields** (array of tables — extracts from body lines):

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pattern` | string (regex) | yes | Regex with one capture group. Scans all chunk lines; first match wins. |
| `as` | string | yes | Variable name to bind the extracted value to |
| `carry_forward` | bool | no | When `true`, inherit from previous chunk if not matched. Default: `false`. |

**`[[chunk.aggregate]]` fields** (array of tables — per-chunk aggregation):

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pattern` | string (regex) | yes | Regex to match against each chunk line |
| `sum` | string | no | Variable name to bind the sum of matched capture group values (parsed as integers) |
| `count_as` | string | no | Variable name to bind the count of lines matching the pattern |

At least one of `sum` or `count_as` must be set per aggregate rule.

**Key normalization**: All chunk items are normalized to have the same set of keys. Missing fields default to empty string. This prevents template variables from one chunk item bleeding through to another during `each` rendering.

**Accessing chunk data in templates**:

| Expression | Description |
|---|---|
| `{suites_detail}` | The structured collection (flat or tree) |
| `{suites_detail.count}` | Number of items (or groups, if grouped) |
| `{suites_detail \| each: "..."}` | Iterate over items; named fields are available as `{field_name}` |

**Tree output** (when both `group_by` and `children_as` are set):

Inside an `each` template iterating over a tree collection, the children are accessible by the `children_as` name and support their own `each`/`join` pipes:

```toml
output = "{suites_detail | each: \"  {crate_name}: {passed} passed\\n{children | each: \\\"    {suite_name}: {passed}\\\" | join: \\\"\\\\n\\\"}\" | join: \"\\n\"}"
```

---

## `[json]`

**Type**: table
**Required**: no
**Incompatible with**: `[[section]]`, `[parse]`, `[[chunk]]` (when `[json]` is configured, those steps are skipped)

JSON extraction using `JSONPath` (RFC 9535). For commands that produce JSON output.

```toml
[json]

[[json.extract]]
path = "$.version"
as = "ver"

[[json.extract]]
path = "$.items[*]"
as = "pods"

[[json.extract.fields]]
field = "metadata.name"
as = "name"

[[json.extract.fields]]
field = "status.phase"
as = "phase"

[on_success]
output = "v{ver} — Pods ({pods_count}):\n{pods | each: \"  {name}: {phase}\" | join: \"\\n\"}"
```

**`[[json.extract]]` fields**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | yes | `JSONPath` expression (RFC 9535). Examples: `"$.version"` (scalar), `"$.items[*]"` (array), `"$[*]"` (root array). |
| `as` | string | yes | Variable name to bind the result to. Arrays also generate `{as_name_count}`. |
| `fields` | array of tables | no | Sub-field extraction rules for each matched object. When absent, objects are auto-flattened (all top-level scalars become fields). |

**`[[json.extract.fields]]` fields**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `field` | string | yes | Dot-separated path within each matched object (not JSONPath). Supports nested traversal (`"metadata.name"`) and numeric array indices (`"containers.0.name"`). |
| `as` | string | yes | Variable name for the extracted value. Available in `each` templates. |

**Result mapping**:

| JSONPath result | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Single scalar (string/number/bool/null) | Stored as `vars["as_name"]` — use as `{as_name}` in templates |
| Single array node | Treated as multi-result (items extracted from array elements) |
| Multiple nodes (array) | Stored as `ChunkData::Flat` collection; auto-generates `{as_name_count}` |
| Objects without `fields` | All top-level scalar fields auto-flattened into chunk items |
| Objects with `fields` | Only specified fields extracted per item |
| Empty array (with `fields`) | Emits `{as_name_count} = "0"` |

**Error handling**:

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Input is not valid JSON | Extraction skipped entirely; pipeline falls back to raw output (templates are not rendered) |
| Invalid JSONPath expression | That rule silently skipped; other rules still run |
| Path matches nothing | No vars/chunks produced for that rule; `{as_name_count} = "0"` when `fields` are specified |
| Missing sub-field in object | Defaults to empty string |

**Pipeline position**: runs after `lua_script` (step 7 in the processing order). When `[json]` is configured, `[[section]]`, `[parse]`, and `[[chunk]]` are skipped — JSON replaces line-based structural processing. The extracted vars and chunks flow into `[on_success]`/`[on_failure]` template rendering, where they work with all standard template pipes (`each`, `join`, `where`, `truncate`, `lines`).

**Accessing JSON data in templates**:

| Expression | Description |
|---|---|
| `{var_name}` | Scalar variable extracted by JSONPath |
| `{array_name_count}` | Number of items in an extracted array |
| `{array_name \| each: "..." \| join: "\\n"}` | Iterate over array items with field access |

---

## `[parse]`

**Type**: table
**Required**: no
**Incompatible with**: `[[section]]`

Declarative structured parser for table-like command output. Designed for commands like `git status --porcelain`, `docker ps`, `kubectl get pods`.

```toml
[parse]
branch = { line = 1, pattern = '## (\S+?)(?:\.\.\.(\S+))?', output = "{1}" }

[parse.group]
key = { pattern = '^(.{2}) ', output = "{1}" }
labels = { "M " = "modified", "??" = "untracked", "D " = "deleted" }
```

**`[parse]` fields**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `branch` | inline table | no | Extract a single value from a specific line number |

**`branch` fields**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `line` | integer | yes | 1-based line number to extract from |
| `pattern` | string (regex) | yes | Pattern to match against that line |
| `output` | string | yes | Template for the extracted value; `{1}`, `{2}`, … for capture groups |

**`[parse.group]` fields**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `key` | inline table | yes | How to extract the grouping key from each line |
| `labels` | inline table (string → string) | no | Map from raw key string to human-readable label |

**`key` fields**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pattern` | string (regex) | yes | Pattern to match against a line to extract the group key |
| `output` | string | yes | Template for the key value; `{1}`, `{2}`, … for capture groups |

---

## `[output]`

**Type**: table
**Required**: no (but usually paired with `[parse]`)

Defines the output format when using `[parse]`.

```toml
[output]
format = """
{branch}{tracking_info}
{group_counts}"""
group_counts_format = "  {label}: {count}"
empty = "clean — nothing to commit"
```

**Fields**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `format` | string | yes | Overall output template. Has access to `{branch}` (from `parse.branch`), `{tracking_info}`, `{group_counts}`. |
| `group_counts_format` | string | no | Template for each group entry. Variables: `{label}` (from `labels` map), `{count}` (number of lines in group). Default: `{label}: {count}` |
| `empty` | string | no | String to emit when no lines were grouped (empty output). Default: empty string. |

---

## `[on_success]`

**Type**: table
**Required**: no

Output branch executed when the command exits with code 0.

```toml
[on_success]
output = "ok ✓ {branch}"
head = 20
tail = 10
skip = ["^\\s*$"]
extract = { pattern = '(\S+)\s*->\s*(\S+)', output = "ok ✓ {2}" }

# Singular form (one rule):
aggregate = { from = "summary_lines", pattern = 'ok\. (\d+) passed', sum = "passed", count_as = "suites" }

# Plural form (multiple rules) — use [[on_success.aggregates]]:
# [[on_success.aggregates]]
# from = "summary_lines"
# pattern = 'ok\. (\d+) passed'
# sum = "passed"
# count_as = "suites"
#
# [[on_success.aggregates]]
# from = "summary_lines"
# pattern = '(\d+) failed'
# sum = "failed"
```

**Fields**:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `output` | string | Template for the final output. Has access to all `[[section]]` and `[[chunk]]` variables, plus `{output}` (filtered output text). |
| `head` | integer | Keep only the first N lines of filtered output. |
| `tail` | integer | Keep only the last N lines of filtered output. |
| `skip` | array of strings | Additional regexes to filter output lines within this branch. |
| `extract` | inline table | Find the first matching line, render a template with capture groups. |
| `aggregate` | inline table | Reduce section lines into numeric summaries (singular form — one rule). |
| `aggregates` | array of tables | Multiple aggregate rules (plural form — use `[[on_success.aggregates]]`). |

Both singular `aggregate` and plural `aggregates` can be used together — they are merged at runtime.

**`extract` fields**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pattern` | string (regex) | yes | Pattern to search for (first match wins) |
| `output` | string | yes | Template with `{1}`, `{2}`, … for capture groups |

**`aggregate` / `aggregates` fields** (same schema for both forms):

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `from` | string | yes | Variable name (must match a `collect_as` value from `[[section]]`) |
| `pattern` | string (regex) | yes | Regex with one integer capture group to extract a number from each line |
| `sum` | string | no | Variable name to bind the sum of all extracted numbers to |
| `count_as` | string | no | Variable name to bind the count of matched lines to |

---

## `[on_failure]`

**Type**: table
**Required**: no

Output branch executed when the command exits with a non-zero code. Has the same fields as `[on_success]`.

```toml
[on_failure]
tail = 20
output = """
FAILED ({failure_blocks.count} failures):
{failure_blocks | each: "{index}. {value | truncate: 200}" | join: "\\n"}
{summary_lines | join: "\\n"}"""
```

Same fields as `[on_success]`. See above.

**Recommendation**: Always include `[on_failure]` with at least `tail = 20`. Users debugging failures need context.

---

## `[fallback]`

**Type**: table
**Required**: no

Emitted when neither `[on_success]` nor `[on_failure]` produced output.

```toml
[fallback]
tail = 5
```

**Fields**:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `tail` | integer | Keep the last N lines of filtered output |

**When this triggers**: if `[on_success]` or `[on_failure]` has an `output` template that renders to empty, or if neither branch is defined for the given exit code, `[fallback]` activates.

**Recommendation**: Always add `[fallback] tail = 5` to complex filters using `[[section]]`. Acts as a safety net for edge cases.

---

## `strip_ansi`

**Type**: `bool`
**Required**: no
**Default**: `false`

Strip ANSI escape sequences (colors, bold, cursor movement) from each line before skip/keep pattern matching. Applied after `[[replace]]`, before `skip`/`keep`.

```toml
strip_ansi = true
```

**When to use**: for commands that emit colored output (e.g. test runners, linters). Without this, ANSI codes can interfere with regex matching in `skip`, `keep`, and `[[replace]]`.

---

## `trim_lines`

**Type**: `bool`
**Required**: no
**Default**: `false`

Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each line. Applied alongside `strip_ansi`, before `skip`/`keep`.

```toml
trim_lines = true
```

**When to use**: when command output has inconsistent indentation that would complicate regex patterns.

---

## `strip_empty_lines`

**Type**: `bool`
**Required**: no
**Default**: `false`

Remove all blank lines from the final output. Applied as a post-processing step after all other filtering.

```toml
strip_empty_lines = true
```

**When to use**: when the filtered output has excessive blank lines that waste tokens without adding structure.

---

## `collapse_empty_lines`

**Type**: `bool`
**Required**: no
**Default**: `false`

Collapse consecutive blank lines into a single blank line in the final output. Less aggressive than `strip_empty_lines`. Applied as a post-processing step after all other filtering.

```toml
collapse_empty_lines = true
```

**When to use**: when you want to preserve some visual structure (single blank lines as separators) but remove redundant consecutive blanks.

---

## `[[variant]]`

**Type**: array of tables
**Required**: no
**Default**: `[]`

Context-aware delegation to specialized child filters. Used when a single command pattern (e.g. `npm test`) can invoke different underlying tools (Jest, Vitest, Mocha) that produce fundamentally different output.

```toml
command = ["npm test", "pnpm test", "yarn test"]

strip_ansi = true
skip = ["^> "]

[on_success]
output = "{output}"

[on_failure]
tail = 20

[[variant]]
name = "vitest"
detect.files = ["vitest.config.ts", "vitest.config.js", "vitest.config.mts"]
filter = "npm/test-vitest"

[[variant]]
name = "jest"
detect.files = ["jest.config.js", "jest.config.ts", "jest.config.json"]
filter = "npm/test-jest"

[[variant]]
name = "mocha"
detect.output_pattern = "passing|failing|pending"
filter = "npm/test-mocha"
```

**Per-entry fields**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | yes | Human-readable identifier for this variant (used in diagnostics and `--verbose` output) |
| `detect.files` | array of strings | no | File paths to check for existence in the current working directory |
| `detect.output_pattern` | string (regex) | no | Regex to match against the full command output |
| `filter` | string | yes | Filter to delegate to, specified as a relative path without `.toml` (e.g. `"npm/test-vitest"`) |

At least one of `detect.files` or `detect.output_pattern` must be set per variant.

**Two-phase detection**:

1. **File detection (Phase A, pre-execution)**: For each variant with `detect.files`, tokf checks if any of the listed files exist in the current working directory. First file match wins — that variant's filter is used immediately.
2. **Output pattern (Phase B, post-execution)**: Variants with only `detect.output_pattern` are deferred. After the command runs, tokf regex-matches the output against each deferred variant's pattern. First match wins.

File detection takes priority because it happens before execution and avoids unnecessary output analysis.

**Delegation semantics**:
- When a variant matches, the child filter **replaces** the parent entirely — no field inheritance or merging
- When no variant matches, the parent filter's own fields apply as the fallback
- The child filter is a standalone TOML file with its own `command`, `skip`, `on_success`, etc.

**TOML ordering**: `[[variant]]` entries must appear **after** all top-level fields and tables (`skip`, `[on_success]`, `[on_failure]`, etc.) because TOML array-of-tables sections capture all subsequent keys into the array entries.

**Debugging**: Use `tokf which "npm test" -v` to see variant resolution details.

---

## `show_history_hint`

**Type**: `bool`
**Required**: no
**Default**: `false`

When enabled, tokf appends a hint line after the filtered output telling the reader how to retrieve the full, unfiltered output from history.

```toml
command = "git status"
show_history_hint = true

[on_success]
output = "{branch} — {counts}"
```

**Output example**:

```
🗜️ main — modified: 3, untracked: 1
🗜️ compressed — run `tokf raw 42` for full output
```

**Behavior**:
- The hint line is appended to stdout so both humans and LLMs can see it
- The history entry stores the clean filtered output without the hint line
- tokf also auto-appends the hint when it detects the same command running twice in a row (repetition detection), regardless of this setting

**When to use**: for filters that aggressively compress output (e.g. `git status` reducing 30 lines to 1 line), where the LLM consumer might need access to the full output for detailed analysis.
