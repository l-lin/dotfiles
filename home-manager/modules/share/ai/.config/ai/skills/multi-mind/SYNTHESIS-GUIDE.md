# Synthesis Guide

After collecting specialist analyses, synthesize into actionable insights.

## Synthesis Process

### 1. Extract Key Points

From each specialist's analysis, identify:
- Primary recommendation
- Key risks they identified
- Unique insights from their perspective
- Evidence/sources they cited

### 2. Find Patterns

Look for:
- **Convergence**: Where do multiple specialists agree? (high confidence)
- **Divergence**: Where do they disagree? (needs deeper analysis)
- **Blind spots**: What did no specialist address? (potential risk)
- **Novel connections**: Insights that only emerge from combining perspectives

### 3. Resolve Tensions

When specialists disagree:
- Identify the underlying tradeoff (e.g., speed vs safety)
- Note which perspective applies to which context
- Don't force false consensus — preserve the tension if it's real
- Recommend how to decide based on specific priorities

### 4. Prioritize Recommendations

Rank recommendations by:
- **Impact**: How much does this matter?
- **Confidence**: How many specialists support this?
- **Actionability**: Can this be acted on immediately?

### 5. Identify Uncertainties

Be explicit about:
- Questions that couldn't be answered
- Areas needing more research
- Decisions that depend on unknown factors
- Risks that couldn't be quantified

## Synthesis Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Instead |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Averaging** | "Some say X, some say Y, so do half" | Identify when X vs Y applies |
| **Loudest voice** | Letting one specialist dominate | Weight by relevance to the specific question |
| **False consensus** | Forcing agreement where none exists | Preserve productive tension |
| **List dump** | Just concatenating specialist outputs | Actively find connections and conflicts |
| **Hedging everything** | "It depends" without guidance | Specify what it depends on |

## Output Quality Checklist

Before finalizing synthesis:

- [ ] Each specialist's unique contribution is represented
- [ ] Points of agreement are clearly stated
- [ ] Points of tension are explained, not hidden
- [ ] Recommendations are specific and actionable
- [ ] Uncertainties are explicit
- [ ] Next steps are concrete
- [ ] Reader can make a decision based on this output
