# Specialist Selection Guide

Select 3-4 specialists based on the topic. Specialists should provide **error decorrelation** — different blind spots mean combined analysis catches more issues.

## Selection Criteria

Each specialist should have:

1. **Unique domain expertise** relevant to the topic
2. **Different methodological approach** (quantitative vs qualitative, theoretical vs practical)
3. **Varied temporal perspective** (historical patterns, current state, future implications)
4. **Distinct risk sensitivity** (security-minded, cost-focused, user-centric, etc.)

## Example Specialist Assignments

### Technology Choice (e.g., "Kafka vs RabbitMQ")

| Specialist | Focus |
|------------|-------|
| Distributed Systems Expert | Consistency, partitioning, failure modes, scalability limits |
| Operations/DevOps | Deployment, monitoring, operational burden, debugging |
| Developer Experience | API ergonomics, learning curve, ecosystem, documentation |
| Cost Analyst | Licensing, infrastructure costs, team cost, migration cost |

### Architecture Decision (e.g., "Monolith vs Microservices")

| Specialist | Focus |
|------------|-------|
| System Architect | Boundaries, coupling, data flow, evolution path |
| Team/Org Expert | Team structure, cognitive load, ownership, hiring |
| Operations | Deployment complexity, observability, incident response |
| Business Strategist | Time-to-market, flexibility, risk, competitive factors |

### Security Decision (e.g., "Authentication architecture")

| Specialist | Focus |
|------------|-------|
| Security Expert | Threat models, attack vectors, compliance, best practices |
| UX Expert | User friction, recovery flows, accessibility |
| Backend Architect | Integration, session management, scale, performance |
| Compliance/Legal | Regulatory requirements, data residency, audit needs |

### Strategic Decision (e.g., "Build vs Buy")

| Specialist | Focus |
|------------|-------|
| Technical Lead | Capability fit, integration effort, customization needs |
| Product Strategist | Competitive advantage, differentiation, core vs commodity |
| Financial Analyst | TCO, opportunity cost, ROI timeline |
| Risk Analyst | Vendor lock-in, continuity, control, exit strategy |

## Avoid These Mistakes

- **Too similar**: Don't pick "Backend Expert" and "API Expert" — too much overlap
- **Too generic**: "Technical Expert" is too broad; be specific about their lens
- **Missing stakeholder**: Consider who would be affected but might be overlooked
- **All technical**: Include business/user perspectives when relevant

## Naming Specialists

Use clear, specific role names:
- "Distributed Systems Expert" not "Tech Person"
- "Developer Experience Advocate" not "Dev"
- "Security & Compliance Analyst" not "Security"

The name should make the specialist's unique perspective obvious.
