# Writing Clearly and Concisely

## Overview

Use William Strunk Jr.'s _The Elements of Style_ (1918) to write clearly and cut ruthlessly.

## All Rules

### Elementary Rules of Usage (Grammar/Punctuation)

1. Form possessive singular by adding 's
2. Use comma after each term in series except last
3. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas
4. Comma before conjunction introducing co-ordinate clause
5. Don't join independent clauses by comma
6. Don't break sentences in two
7. Participial phrase at beginning refers to grammatical subject

### Elementary Principles of Composition

8. One paragraph per topic
9. Begin paragraph with topic sentence
10. **Use active voice**
11. **Put statements in positive form**
12. **Use definite, specific, concrete language**
13. **Omit needless words**
14. Avoid succession of loose sentences
15. Express co-ordinate ideas in similar form
16. **Keep related words together**
17. Keep to one tense in summaries
18. **Place emphatic words at end of sentence**

### Custom rules

- Preserve every idea and fact unless clarity demands a change
- Keep paragraphs short (no more than three brief sentences)
- Vary sentence length to avoid monotony
- Replace jargon and complex words with plain, direct language; use contractions
- Remove clichés, filler adverbs, and stock metaphors (e.g., "navigate," "journey," "roadmap")
- Avoid bullet points unless essential for scan-ability
- Never add a summary or recap at the end—finish on a crisp, final line
- Do not use em dashes; use commas, periods, or rewrite as needed
- Add dry humor or an idiom if it fits, but never sound like an infomercial
- After rewriting, review and fix any sentence that still feels machine-made
