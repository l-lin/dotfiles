Generate self-contained HTML pages that explain systems, code changes, plans, data, and technical concepts visually. Use this skill for diagram requests, architecture overviews, diff/plan reviews, project recaps, comparison tables, slide decks, and any visual explanation.

## Input

$ARGUMENTS

## Delivery rules

- Prefer an HTML page over terminal ASCII when the output is inherently visual.
- If a table would have 4+ rows or 3+ columns, render it as HTML and give only a short chat summary.
- Write files to `.sandbox/diagrams/YYYY-MM-DD-description/` or the explicit eval output path. Use descriptive filenames.
- Open generated pages in the browser when running normally.
- The final page must be a complete self-contained HTML document, including embedded CSS and any needed JS.

## Choose the representation

| Content | Default representation |
|---|---|
| Flowchart, pipeline, state machine, decision tree | Mermaid |
| Sequence, ER/schema, class, C4, topology-focused architecture | Mermaid |
| Text-heavy architecture, module internals, implementation plans | CSS grid cards, optionally with a Mermaid overview |
| 15+ element architecture | Hybrid: small Mermaid overview + CSS detail cards |
| Comparison/audit/status matrix | Semantic HTML `<table>` |
| Timeline/roadmap | CSS timeline |
| Dashboard/metrics | CSS grid + charts/KPIs |
| Slide deck | `100dvh` slides using slide template patterns |

## Mermaid invariants

- Use `theme: 'base'` with custom `themeVariables` matching the page palette.
- For complex diagrams use ELK layout when available.
- Never use bare `<pre class="mermaid">`.
- Every Mermaid diagram needs zoom in/out/reset/expand controls, Ctrl/Cmd+scroll zoom, drag panning, and click-to-expand.
- Prefer `flowchart TD` for complex diagrams. Use `LR` only for simple 3–4 node linear flows.
- Use `<br/>` in quoted flowchart labels. Do not use escaped `\n` labels.
- Never define page-level `.node`; Mermaid uses it internally. Use namespaced page classes such as `.ve-card`.
- For 15+ elements, do not cram everything into one Mermaid diagram. Use the hybrid overview + cards pattern.

## Layout and style invariants

- ALWAYS use light background.
- Use semantic HTML where it helps accessibility and copy/paste: `<table>`, headings, lists, `<details>`, captions.
- Use CSS custom properties for palette: `--bg`, `--surface`, `--border`, `--text`, `--text-dim`, and 3–5 accents.
- Pick a clear aesthetic direction before writing: blueprint, editorial, paper/ink, terminal, IDE-inspired, or data-dense.
- ALWAYS use minimalist style that highlights readability over nice looking HTML page.
  - Prefer using 5 colors max.
- Prevent overflow: `min-width: 0` on grid/flex children, `overflow-wrap: break-word` for long text, and scroll containers for wide tables/code.
- Do not set `display: flex` directly on `<li>` when list markers matter.
- Use depth sparingly: hero/elevated only for primary sections; flat/recessed for reference material.
- Use entrance/hover animation only when it clarifies hierarchy. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. Do not use continuous glow, pulse, or breathing effects on static content.

## Slide deck mode

Use slides only when explicitly requested or when a command asks for slides. Slides are a different medium, not a paginated article:

- Each slide is one viewport (`100dvh`) with no page-level scrolling.
- Use larger type, fewer objects per slide, varied compositions, and visible navigation.
- Include slide nav chrome: prev/next controls, slide count, keyboard navigation, and carousel dots/indicators.
- Before writing HTML, inventory the source and map every source item to slides.
- Do not drop content to fit a fixed slide count. Add slides instead.

## Final checklist

Before delivery, verify:

- complete HTML document;
- output written to the requested path;
- no console errors when opened;
- no horizontal overflow at normal desktop width;
- fonts load with fallbacks;
- tables preserve rows/columns and wrap long text;
- Mermaid diagrams use `diagram-shell` with zoom/pan/expand;
- slides fit one viewport, include carousel dots, and preserve source coverage;
- visual hierarchy makes the main idea obvious in the first viewport;
