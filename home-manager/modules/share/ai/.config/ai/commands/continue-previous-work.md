description: Continue previous work by looking at git history

Spawn parallel Task agent to understand what changed recently:

1. Check git status and current branch
2. Look at recent commits: git log --oneline -10
3. Check uncommitted changes: git diff
4. Verify expected files exist

Then, we're going to continue to iterate when you're ready.
